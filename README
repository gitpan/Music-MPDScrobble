Music-MPDScrobble version 0.02
==============================

Simple Module to provide a scrobbling service for MPD.  

DISCLAIMER

This is BETA code for testing ONLY.  The included program musicmpdscrobble is an 
example implementation only of Music::MPDScrobble.  A formal release requires an 
ID from last.fm.  While testing your application, you may use the "tst" ID.

INSTALLATION

See the DEPENDENCIES section and install any missing dependencies.  All modules
are available from CPAN (www.cpan.org).

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

CONFIGURATION

There is a sample config file under examples.  A sample init file that I use for 
gentoo linux is there as well. 

USE

Edit the sample config file and copy to /etc/musicmpdscrobble.conf

Test your configuration by issue the command

musicmpdscrobble --logfile=STDERR --monitor

and playing some music.  

If it works, then the command

musicmpdscrobble --daemonize 

runs it as a daemon.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:
File::Spec
Digest::MD5
Encode
IO::Socket
IO::File
Config::Options
LWP::UserAgent
Tie::File

I strongly encourage you to also install my module

Music::Tag

This will allow you to read info from the file tag.

The version info in the Makefile is based on what I use.  You can get 
away with older versions in many cases.

HELP

Is available with perldoc musicmpdscrobble
